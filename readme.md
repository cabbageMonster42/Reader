Factual Question-Answering Chatbot Documentation
Introduction
The Factual Question-Answering Chatbot is an application that utilizes the OpenAI API to provide accurate answers to user questions based on a given URL and HTML tags. The chatbot scrapes the content from the provided URL, processes it, and generates responses using OpenAI's language models. This documentation provides an overview of the code structure and how it works.

Code Structure
The project consists of the following main files:

main.py: This is the entry point of the application. It prompts the user to enter a URL and HTML tags, scrapes the content from the URL using the specified tags, and launches the chat interface.
utils.py: This file contains utility functions used in the main script, including functions for getting content from a URL, calculating embeddings, finding similar embeddings, and interacting with the OpenAI API.
.env: This file stores environment variables, including the OpenAI API key.
Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

openai: The OpenAI Python library for interacting with the OpenAI API.
dotenv: A library for loading environment variables from a .env file.
requests: A library for making HTTP requests.
beautifulsoup4: A library for web scraping.
gradio: A library for creating web-based user interfaces.
numpy: A library for numerical computations.
Setup and Configuration
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/factual-question-answering-chatbot.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain an OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.
Create a .env file in the project directory and add the following line: OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key, replacing your-api-key with your actual API key.
Usage
To use the factual question-answering chatbot, follow these steps:

Run the main script: Execute the main.py script using the command python main.py. This will prompt you to enter a URL and HTML tags for content scraping.
Enter the URL: Provide the URL of the webpage you want to scrape.
Enter the HTML tags: Specify the HTML tags, separated by commas, that you want to scrape from the webpage.
Chat with the bot: Once the content is scraped and the chatbot interface is launched, you can ask questions, and the chatbot will provide responses based on the scraped content and OpenAI models.
How It Works
Scraping content: The get_content function in utils.py retrieves the content from the specified URL using the provided HTML tags. It returns a list of cleaned texts extracted from the HTML elements.

Embeddings generation: The get_embedding function takes the cleaned texts and uses the OpenAI Embeddings API to generate embeddings for each text. It returns a dictionary of embeddings and the corresponding cleaned texts.

Similar embeddings: The find_similar_embeddings function calculates the similarity between a user's question (query) and the precomputed embeddings. It returns the indexes of the top 5 most similar documents.

Chatbot interaction: The chatbot function takes a user's question, the embeddings, and the cleaned texts. It constructs a prompt by including relevant context from the similar documents and the user's question. It then sends the prompt to the OpenAI Completions API and retrieves the generated response.

Chat interface: The main script prompts the user to enter a URL and HTML tags for content scraping. It calls the necessary functions from utils.py to scrape the content, generate embeddings, and interact with the chatbot model. It uses the gr.Interface from Gradio to create a user-friendly chat interface.

User interaction: Once the chat interface is launched, the user can ask questions by typing them into the input box. The chatbot uses the precomputed embeddings and the user's question to provide accurate answers based on the scraped content and contextual information.

Response generation: The chatbot sends the user's question and relevant context to the OpenAI Completions API using the prompt generated in the chatbot function. It receives a response from the API, which is then displayed in the chat interface as the chatbot's answer to the user's question.

Iterative conversation: The user can continue asking questions and having a conversation with the chatbot by entering their queries into the input box. The chatbot generates responses based on the updated context and information provided.

Customization
Model selection: The chatbot currently uses the text-davinci-002 model for response generation. If you want to use a different model, you can modify the model parameter in the openai.Completion.create function call in the chatbot function.

Temperature and max tokens: The temperature and max tokens parameters in the openai.Completion.create function can be adjusted to control the randomness and length of the generated responses.

HTML parsing and content selection: If you want to scrape different content or additional information from the web page, you can modify the get_content function in utils.py to extract the desired HTML elements and update the content processing logic accordingly.

Conclusion
The Factual Question-Answering Chatbot provides a straightforward way to scrape web content, generate embeddings, and deliver accurate responses to user questions. By combining OpenAI's language models and web scraping techniques, this chatbot can be customized to various use cases, such as providing factual information, answering FAQs, or assisting with research tasks.

Please note that the chatbot's performance heavily relies on the quality of the scraped content and the capabilities of the selected language model.
